"""Static configuration schema for one VULCAN-JAX -> ExoJax transmission SMC retrieval.

This mirrors the SWAMPE ``pipeline.Config`` pattern: a single frozen dataclass, with
per-planet ``*_config()`` PRESETS living in each run's ``case.py`` (see
``runs/w39b_smc_retrieval/case.py``), not here. The parameter vector is

    theta = [ lnZ, dln(C/O), lnKzz,   <T-P params>,   lnR0,  offset_g ... ]
            |------ VULCAN chemistry (3) ------|      radius   inter-instrument
                                 + ExoJax Guillot T-P            offsets (G-1)

The chemistry parameters (lnZ, dln(C/O), lnKzz) and the T-P parameters all require
re-converging VULCAN and are the *expensive* directions of every forward-mode
gradient; ``lnR0`` and the instrument offsets are applied analytically after the
spectrum and are cheap.

Planet identity enters through explicit fields a case preset sets: the observed
spectrum (``obs_dir`` + ``obs_products`` + ``combo``), the VULCAN baseline config
module (``vulcan_cfg_module``), gravity/radii (``tp_gravity_cgs``, ``rp_cm``,
``rstar_cm``), and the priors. Field defaults document the shapes/scales of the
original WASP-39b application; every case preset overrides what defines its planet.

All fields are overridable per preset via kwargs, and at run time via the
``SMC_RETRIEVAL_OVERRIDES`` / ``SMC_RETRIEVAL_OVERRIDES_FILE`` JSON hooks read by
``retrieval.run_smc`` (identical mechanism to the SWAMPE driver).
