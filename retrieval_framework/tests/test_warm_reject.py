"""Regression test for the warm-proposal convergence gate
(pipeline._make_batch_eval, warm + want_grad; retrieval_forward.chem_solve_warm_diag).

A warm_count_max-exhausted (non-converged) warm MALA proposal must be REJECTED (-1e30
L, dropped from n_bad_grad), NOT fed into the jvp/RT-vjp as a finite-likelihood MH
candidate -- the pre-fix behavior that surfaced as a spurious n_bad_grad RuntimeError
(or a NaN gradient) at SMC stage 0 and made the timing calibration fail. See CLAUDE.md
"Cold-init reject-and-cull" (the warm-mutation analogue that was previously deferred).

Also covers the 2026-07-09 warm-cap plumbing: the warm solvers run a TWIN runner
capped at warm_count_max < count_max, so a doomed proposal is cut off at the warm cap
(here 5) instead of marching to the cold cap (here 50) -- asserted via the observed
accept_count landing at the warm cap, far below the cold one.

This builds the REAL smoke pipeline (CO-only, fully offline) with warm_count_max=5 so
every warm continuation from the baseline column is guaranteed non-converged (the
readiness floor count_min=120 alone forbids convergence in 5 steps). It is a heavier
integration test than the rest of the suite (~1-3 min: real chemistry+RT build + a
couple of XLA compiles) and SKIPS cleanly when the VULCAN-JAX / ExoJax stack or its
data/env is unavailable.
